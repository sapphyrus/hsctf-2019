Was bored and played this for a few hours..

I had my fair share of fun and learned a lot of things, even though I was really late to the game (and sadly spoiled myself a few challenges just from hanging around in the discord) and it was really python heavy.

Some challenges were also a little on the easier side but I still think this was a decent first CTF.
